  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical
	processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the
	physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes
	affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential
	of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and
	major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology.
	There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical
	components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements
	qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing.
	Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented
	software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls
	and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing
	such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today¿s
	computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation
	for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design
	processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or
	otherwise) designs that are built on today¿s abstractions. To realize
	the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and
	networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace
	physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

  abstract = {Today's electricity grid is transitioning to a so-called smart grid.
	The associated challenges and funding initiatives have spurred great
	efforts from the research community to propose innovative smart grid
	solutions. To assess the performance of possible solutions, simulation
	tools offer a cost effective and safe approach. In this paper we
	will provide a comprehensive overview of various tools and their
	characteristics, applicable in smart grid research: we will cover
	both the communication and associated ICT infrastructure, on top
	of the power grid. First, we discuss the motivation for the development
	of smart grid simulators, as well as their associated research questions
	and design challenges. Next, we discuss three types of simulators
	in the smart grid area: power system simulators, communication network
	simulators, and combined power and communication simulators. To summarize
	the findings from this survey, we classify the different simulators
	according to targeted use cases, simulation model level of detail,
	and architecture. To conclude, we discuss the use of standards and
	multi-agent based modeling in smart grid simulation.},
